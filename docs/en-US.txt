# IT Development & Integration Team Requirements

## 1. Core Functions
- Real-time analytics on CCTV streams for two use-cases:
  - **Unsafe-Behavior Detection**: 8 classes (no helmet, no vest, no air blower, fall, absence, motionless, intrusion, improper floor covering)
  - **People Counting**: Bi-directional at entrances
- Continuous or scheduled detection; each analytic can be toggled per camera/zone

## 2. Video Inputs & Infrastructure
- Re-use existing CCTV cameras; add/relocate cameras (and expand CCTV NVRs) as needed for sufficient views/resolution
- VAS must:
  - Pull live streams
  - Create 10s event clips (−5s / +5s)
  - Encrypt and expose clips to authorized workstations and EMSD CMP (remote HQ)
- Support ≥100 simultaneous 2MP streams for inference
- Alert latency <5s
- Accuracy >90%, false alarms <10%

## 3. Hardware & Performance Targets
- GPU-backed, high-performance servers
- Clustering with local 1+1 hot-standby and remote 1+1 option
- RAID-1 or better on each server; automatic fail-over with no visible interruption
- At least 30% spare compute at peak and 20% expansion headroom
- Support ≥5 concurrent client workstations (local/remote) with smooth UX

## 4. Software Architecture & Extensibility
- Multi-client / multi-server, distributed services over authenticated TCP/IP
- All traffic over HTTPS (or similar) with encryption & digital signatures
- Open plugin/SDK framework:
  - Import 3rd-party AI models (formats: GGUF, Safetensors, PyTorch, ONNX)
  - New analytics must be configurable like built-ins
- Server-side plugin support for new device types & entities
- Must run on 64-bit Windows Server 2022 / Windows 11 (or equivalent)
- SQL-based central database; each server keeps a local DB and syncs with master

## 5. User Roles, Security & Data Protection
- Roles: Operator, Supervisor, Administrator; fine-grained rights (view, export, configure, etc.)
- Supervisor can force log-off any workstation
- All account/config data encrypted
- Double-authentication required for mass exports
- Device discovery & quarantine for unauthorized hardware
- Offline, centrally-applied software updates

## 6. Workstation GUI Requirements
- Live/event video, zoom, playback
- Alarm console, reports, dynamic map, zone/line drawing for analytics, algorithm parameter tuning
- Search/filter historical alarms, bulk export (local, NAS, SAN)
- License management for devices/channels

## 7. Monitoring & Reporting
- Real-time health alarms (server, analytics module, DB, stream quality, licenses, user log-ins)
- Built-in report generator: user audit, alarms, equipment/connection faults, health, server monitoring

## 8. Storage & Retention
- Alarms, logs, event clips kept ≥30 days
- Mass-export and backup features; encrypted output

## 9. Accuracy & Acceptance Testing
- Contractor to supply actors, props, etc., to build ≥5,000-image/clip test set per algorithm
- System must pass accuracy benchmarks during acceptance

## 10. External Connectivity
- Broadband link to EMSD CMP (application/subscription handled by Contractor, fees by Client)
- VAS alerts and clips viewable at CMP workstations

## 11. Deliverables & Support
- Servers, workstations, cabling, racks, licenses
- Ongoing tech support for algorithm fine-tuning and 3rd-party integration (rate-card basis)
- Detailed installation plans/location drawings to be agreed before each Task Order

## 12. Actionable Next Steps for Dev Team
- Design distributed GPU server cluster with 1+1 fail-over, 100-stream capacity +30% spare
- Define micro-service or modular architecture enforcing encrypted TCP/IP & HTTPS
- Build UI specs covering all GUI items listed in §4.5.1
- Plan role-based access control & encryption strategy (accounts, config, video, exports)
- Implement plugin/SDK layer and model-import workflow for additional analytics
- Draft integration plan with existing CCTV (stream acquisition APIs) and with EMSD CMP (network, protocol, auth)
- Establish logging, health-monitoring, reporting and retention modules
